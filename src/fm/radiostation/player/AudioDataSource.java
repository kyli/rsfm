/**
 * An instance of this class handles the details in both connecting to the
 * Last.fm data source and package the InputStream into AudioSourceStream, which
 * is read by the Player to stream audio data to the client.
 * <p>
 * The current implementation handles media data source similar to other Last.fm
 * clients. It does not store any audio metadata in local file system. It
 * connects directly to the remote data source and opens InputStream for direct
 * reading of audio data.
 * <p>
 * Similar to other Last.fm clients, this implementation does not allow random
 * seeking functionalities, but stop or skip the current track is allowed.
 * <p>
 * Initial http connection made to play.Last.fm is through the url found in
 * {@link Track#getLocation()}. The response code will be 302, indicating a http
 * redirection to one of its data servers. The location to the actual mp3 audio
 * resource is included in the response headers, with the property "Location".
 * <p>
 * Second data connection made to sN.last.fm, where N specifies the server it's
 * pointing to, is through the url found in
 * {@link HttpConnection#getHeaderField(String)}, using property "Location", as
 * result of the first http request. The input stream opened from this
 * connection points to the remote data source.
 *
